# Getting started with Angular 2

This repository contains the application which was demoed during the *Getting started with Angular 2* talk at RealDolmen's Java Community Conference.

## Prerequisites

To run the application you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 4 or greater. When installed, you can verify the versions by executing the following commands in your command line of choice:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

Once Node is installed, install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) by executing:

```
npm install -g angular-cli
```

## Installing and running the application

Clone this repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/dahemmer/angular2-getting-started.git
```

Once the repository is cloned, install the needed dependencies (this might take some time):

```
cd angular2-getting-started
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing:

```
ng serve
```

The application is now up and running. Open up your browser at `http://localhost:4200` to check out the application!
